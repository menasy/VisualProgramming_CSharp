# Visual Programming C# Projects

This repository includes a collection of projects that demonstrate my work in **Visual Programming** using C#. The projects span a variety of domains, such as authentication systems, quiz games, betting simulations, pricing systems, and reservation management. Each project is designed with a focus on user interaction, dynamic content generation, and real-time performance feedback.

## Projects Overview

### 1. [**Login System & Quiz Game**](https://github.com/menasy/VisualProgramming_CSharp/tree/main/MehmetNasimYilmazH8S1/H8Exam1)
   A simple login and quiz game where users authenticate with a username and password and then take a quiz with random numbers to select from. The system tracks performance and provides feedback on the results.  

### 2. [**Investment & Betting Game**](https://github.com/menasy/VisualProgramming_CSharp/tree/main/MehmetNasimYilmazH8S2/H8Exam2)
   A dynamic betting system where users invest a certain amount and place bets on randomly generated numbers. The system tracks wins and losses, providing real-time feedback.  

### 3. [**Hotel & Car Rental Pricing System**](https://github.com/menasy/VisualProgramming_CSharp/tree/main/MehmetNasimYilmazH5P1/H5Project1/H5Project1)
   A pricing system where users can choose hotels, cars, and additional services like meals or insurance, and dynamically calculate the total cost of the reservation.  

### 4. [**Ticket Pricing & Services**](https://github.com/menasy/VisualProgramming_CSharp/tree/main/MehmetNasimYilmazH7S1/MehmetNasimYilmazH7S1/MehmetNasimYilmazH6D1/H6Ders1)
   A ticket sales and pricing system that calculates the total cost of tickets, including additional services like meals, insurance, baggage, and discounts for children and infants.  

In addition to these, I have created various other smaller projects, each contributing to the development of my skills in user interface design, dynamic content generation, and handling user input.

## Key Features

The key features of the projects in this repository are outlined below:

- **Login Systems**: User access and authentication processes have been designed to support different user scenarios. For instance, the "Login System & Quiz Game" project performs username and password validation and allows users to securely log in.

- **Dynamic Content Generation**: Random content creation, real-time feedback, and adaptive game flow enhance user interaction. In the "Investment & Betting Game" project, for example, betting options and investment amounts are dynamically generated.

- **User Interface Design**: User-friendly graphical interfaces have been developed using C# with Windows Forms or WPF. This is particularly evident in the "Hotel & Car Rental Pricing System" and "Ticket Pricing & Services" projects, where user interaction is visually supported.

- **Score Tracking and Performance Feedback**: The system tracks user progress and performance in real-time, providing feedback at every stage. For example, in the "Login System & Quiz Game" project, correct/incorrect answers and user performance are provided as feedback.

## Technologies Used

The main technologies used across the projects are as follows:

- **C# Programming Language**: The core language for all projects, handling the business logic, user interaction, and system flow.

- **Windows Forms / WPF**: Frameworks used for designing graphical user interfaces (GUI). Most of the projects utilize these tools to create dynamic and user-friendly interfaces.

- **Visual Studio**: The preferred Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for C# development, used for the entire project development process.

- **.NET Framework**: Provides the basic infrastructure for application development, especially for Windows Forms applications.

## Objectives & Learning Outcomes

The key learning outcomes and objectives through this repository are as follows:

- **C# and OOP Principles**: Enhancing my skills in object-oriented programming and C# fundamentals. In my projects, I focused on object interaction and class design.

- **GUI Design**: Designing graphical user interfaces using Windows Forms and WPF, and enabling user interaction. This process allowed me to create intuitive and visually appealing user interfaces.

- **Dynamic Content Generation**: Creating random content and performance tracking without relying on databases or external dependencies. This is especially evident in the "Investment & Betting Game" project, where random numbers are generated for interactive gameplay.

- **Event-Driven Programming**: Developing applications based on user interactions and events, reinforcing my understanding of event-driven programming. This approach plays a key role in projects like "Login System & Quiz Game" and "Ticket Pricing & Services."

## Overview of Projects

The main themes I focused on in these projects include:

- **User Interaction and Dynamic Content**: My projects are designed to engage users by constantly providing new content and real-time feedback. For example, in the "Ticket Pricing & Services" project, users dynamically see pricing and service options based on their selections.

- **Complex Business Logic**: Each project incorporates specific business logic, such as a quiz game, hotel and car rental system, or ticket pricing calculation. This logic adapts according to different user interactions.

- **Feedback and Performance Tracking**: Real-time feedback is provided to users based on their actions. This allows for an improved user experience and clear insights into how users are interacting with the system.
